## Flight Research Summary (Feb 2026)

### 1. Toronto → Porto (July 23) – DIRECT AVAILABLE ✓

- **Direct flights exist** (Air Canada, TAP Air Portugal, Air Transat, etc.).
- **Price ranges seen (CAD):**
  - One-way: **CA$328–400** (promo) to **CA$600+**
  - Round-trip: **CA$601–680** (promo) to **CA$818+** (Air Canada), **~CA$866** July average (Air Transat)
- **Booking tip:** July is peak; book **as early as possible**. For summer Europe, 3–6 months ahead (or up to 9–12 months for best selection) is often recommended. You’re already inside that window.
- **Where to check:** Google Flights (YYZ→OPO), Expedia.ca, KAYAK.ca, Skyscanner.ca, Air Canada, TAP, Air Transat.

---

### 2. Aug 5: Train Coimbra → Lisbon, then fly Lisbon → Madeira ✓

- **Train from Coimbra to Lisbon** (mom lives near Coimbra; train from Coimbra can go to Porto or Lisbon; for this plan, take it to **Lisbon**).
- **A few hours in Lisbon** (e.g. morning train, midday/afternoon in the city), then **fly Lisbon → Funchal** in the afternoon or evening. Multiple LIS→FNC flights daily (TAP, easyJet, Ryanair); ~1h35.
- **LIS→FNC one-way:** often **~$18–55**. Book for **Aug 5** (afternoon/evening departure so you have Lisbon time).
- **Where to check:** Google Flights (LIS→FNC), KAYAK, Skyscanner, Expedia. Confirm an afternoon/evening flight exists for Aug 5 when you book.

---

### 4. Madeira → Toronto – arrive Aug 9 or 10 (choose by price)

- Book the return so you **arrive in Toronto on Aug 9 or 10**—pick whichever date is cheaper.
- **There are no direct flights Funchal (FNC) → Toronto (YYZ).** All options require at least one connection (usually via Lisbon).
- **Two main return strategies:**

| Option | Route | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **A. Via Lisbon** | FNC → LIS → YYZ | Single ticket (e.g. TAP), one check-in, airline protects connection | Connection can be tight (e.g. 1h35); book as one itinerary |
| **B. Direct from Madeira** | FNC → [other EU hub] → YYZ | Sometimes different price/schedule | Usually means 2 stops or less convenient; still no “direct” FNC–YYZ |

- **Lisbon → Toronto** (for the LIS–YYZ segment):
  - One-way: **~CA$237–455** (TAP nonstop often **~$430–455**; Air Canada, Air Transat similar).
  - Round-trip LIS–YYZ: **~CA$431+**.
- **Funchal → Toronto** (one-way, with connection):
  - **~CA$289–316 USD** (Expedia) and **~CA$852** (Google Flights) for full FNC–YYZ – **high variance; compare multi-city vs separate tickets.**

**Recommendation:** Compare:
1. **Multi-city:** YYZ→OPO (Jul 23), FNC→YYZ (Aug 9 or 10) on one booking (e.g. Google Flights “multi-city”, or TAP/AC).
2. **Separate bookings:**  
   - (a) YYZ→OPO outbound;  
   - (b) **LIS→FNC** (one-way, Aug 5 afternoon/evening);  
   - (c) FNC→LIS→YYZ (single ticket, e.g. TAP) for return.

Often **FNC→LIS→YYZ on one ticket** is similar or cheaper than FNC→other hubs→YYZ and avoids connection risk. **Book return as one through-ticket (FNC→LIS→YYZ)** so the airline protects the Lisbon connection.

## Booking Strategy – What to Do First

1. **Lock Toronto → Porto (July 23)**  
   - Compare: Google Flights, Expedia.ca, KAYAK.ca, Skyscanner.ca, Air Canada, TAP, Air Transat.  
   - Book soon; July is expensive.

2. **Book train Coimbra → Lisbon for Aug 5** (departure that gets you to Lisbon with time for a few hours in the city).  
3. **Lock Lisbon → Funchal (Aug 5 afternoon/evening)**  
   - Book **LIS→FNC for Aug 5** so you have time in Lisbon first, then fly to Madeira same day. Compare: Google Flights (LIS→FNC), KAYAK, Skyscanner, Expedia.  
   - Often very cheap; book separately.

4. **Lock Funchal → Toronto (arrive Aug 9 or 10)**  
   - Book so you **arrive in Toronto** on **Aug 9 or 10**—compare both dates and choose the cheaper one.  
   - Prefer **one ticket FNC→LIS→YYZ** (e.g. TAP, or via Google Flights multi-city).  
   - Compare multi-city (YYZ→OPO out, FNC→YYZ return) vs separate bookings.

## Decisions to Make

- [ ] **Return:** Arrive Toronto **Aug 9 or Aug 10**—check both arrival dates and choose the cheaper one.
- [ ] **Return routing:** Book FNC→LIS→YYZ as **one ticket** (recommended) vs two separate tickets.
- [ ] **Multi-city vs separate:** Run a multi-city (YYZ→OPO, FNC→YYZ) quote and compare to (YYZ→OPO) + (train Coimbra→Lisbon) + (LIS→FNC Aug 5) + (FNC→LIS→YYZ).

Once flights are booked, we can add a short **Madeira accommodation** section and any **ground transport** notes (e.g. Porto↔Lisbon if you use it) to this doc or a separate file.

---

## Lisbon on the Return: Layover / Stopover

**Long layover is not required.** Choose your return (FNC→LIS→YYZ) based on **price and flight options**. A short connection in Lisbon (e.g. ~1h30) is fine and often cheaper; book as one ticket so the airline protects the connection.

**If you ever want to leave the airport in Lisbon:** You’d need 6+ hours between flights (8–12h is comfortable). Options: (a) pick an itinerary with a long connection, or (b) add a free TAP stopover in Lisbon (up to 10 days) when booking. See [TAP Stopover](https://www.flytap.com/en-us/stopover). For this trip, **prioritize price and schedule**; no need to force a long layover.
